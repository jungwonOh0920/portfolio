# Portfolio Site

This is my humble portfolio site using Next.js. It has my work experiences, Projects, Resume, and people's words who worked with me in the past including my wife. It can also have night or day mode depending on your preference. I am using Notion as my database for my work experience & project just for fun 😆

It's live so you can check it out. https://portfolio-jungwonoh0920.vercel.app/

If you have any questions about me, please let me know! Thanks 🙏
